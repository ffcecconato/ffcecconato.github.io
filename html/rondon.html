                <p>The Rondon Project (Projeto Rondon) is an initiative from the Brazilian Federal Government that takes students from all over the country to promote local sustainable practices and citizenship in the Brazilian municipalities.</p>
                <p>The Rondon Project had its very first edition in 1967, and the project was named after Marshal Cândido Mariano da Silva Rondon, a Brazilian military officer most famous for his telegraph commission and exploration of Mato Grosso state and the Western Amazon Basin, as well as his lifelong support for indigenous Brazilians.</p>
                <p>My participation in the project was in 2016, as part of the Centro Universitário Senac's crew. We developed our tasks and goals during the first semester of the year and afterwards, we travelled to the area where we spent 2 weeks working with the local community.</p>      
                <p>Our destiny was Rio do Fogo, a small town from Rio Grande do Norte state, located in northeast Brazil. Our crew integrated a very well-coordinated operation between universities, the military forces and the local government.</p>
                <p>One of my responsibilities was to coordinate the communication team to ensure production and dissemination of high-quality information during the project. I was also the creator of the photography workshops offered to the entire community of Rio do Fogo, where I taught basic notions of photography applicable on cell phones, basic notions of conservation and preservation of the photographic collection (family album), and possibilities of entrepreneurship in the photographic field.</p>
                <p>Our crew also provided workshops in other fields of knowledge like environmental engineering, fashion, architecture, nutrition and physical education.</p>
                <p>Volunteering at the Rondon Project was an incredible experience, a unique opportunity not only to teach something to those who most need to know but also to learn extremely valuable teachings from them.</p>
